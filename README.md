dsTitles
========

This is a bukkit plugin which adds titles to Minecraft.

New Features to this Fork :
* Registers Placeholders into PlaceholderAPI/DeluxeChat for dsTitle Suffixes/Prefixes. Use these in PlaceholderAPI and DeluxeChat by using %dsTitle_prefix% for prefix or %dsTitle_suffix% for suffix
* Registers PlaceHolders into mvdwPlaceholderAPI for dsTitle Suffixes/Prefixes. Use these in any mvdw plugin if you have mvdwPlaceholderAPI installed by using {dstitle_prefix}
* Ability to set a default prefix and default suffix
* Fixed a few bugs, including the invisible players still having their nametags shown when dsTitle is handling nametags
